# Bitcoin_Inform

My old python project. 
It is not very clean.

I used to have two bitcoin accounts at two different BTC exchanges, Coinbase and CoinMX. 
BTC@CoinMX was usually more expensive than BTC@Coinbase. It was also more volatile.
I was playing arbitarage back in 2015. 
The python code also took care of MACD and RSI
It basically informed me those buy-and-sell timings via email. 

I had a great time for a while. But it turned out CoinMX was fraud :(

# Bitcoin_Inform

My old python project. 
It is not very clean.

I had two bitcoin exchange accounts, Coinbase and CoinMX. 
BTC@CoinMX was usually more expensive than BTC@Coinbase. It was also more volatile.
I was playing arbitarage back in 2015. 
I think the python code also calculates MACD and RSI

I had a great time for a while. But it turned out CoinMX was fraud :(
